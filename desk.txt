On the desk you see the following items:

An older television. It is a TV/VCR combo. An old television that plays
videotapes. You know, those things that almost-boomers watched movies on back
in the day. They look like big cassette tapes . . . you know, those things that
. . . never mind.

A tablet. At least there are some modern items on the desk.

A transparent item that looks like a tablet but you are not quite sure what it
is. It definitely looks more modern than the tablet.

A note.
