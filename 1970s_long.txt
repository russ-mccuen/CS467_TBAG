You are in a big room with loud music, lights, and people dancing. There
appears to be a DJ in one corner playing . . . records.

The decor of the room is flashy and colorful, with neon lights everywhere. The
people are dressed fashionably and glamorous, wearing sequined and glittery
clothing, platform shoes, and knee-high boots.

It's a really vibrant and exciting place. You feel energized immediately and
then the combination of the music, the clothes, and the atmosphere hits you.

You are in a disco.

The dance floor is in the center of the room and seems like it might be worth
watching.

And there is a disco ball hanging above the center of the dance floor that you
can't help but want to look at.
