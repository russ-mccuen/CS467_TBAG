You finally break free from the hold of the music and decide to take in your
surroundings.

You are in a big room with loud music, lights, and people dancing. There
appears to be a DJ in one corner playing . . . records.

The decor of the room is flashy and colorful, with neon lights everywhere. The
people are dressed fashionably and glamorous, wearing sequined and glittery
clothing, platform shoes, and knee-high boots. There are lights are flashing
all around, and everyone is dressed to impress. You can feel the energy of the
crowd. It's like one big party, and you're a part of it.

The combination of the music, the clothes, and the atmosphere hits you.

You are in a disco.

The dance floor is in the center of the room and seems like it might be worth
watching.

And there is a disco ball hanging above the center of the dance floor that you
can't help but want to look at.
