The poster on the wall will be the second feature. At first it will only
contain a background image. Then as you go to each room something new will
appear on the poster. The poster will tell the story the character is going
through in the game. For example, the first time you examine the poster can be
something like:

You look at the poster on the wall and notice it is kind of . . . boring. There
 is some grass, a night sky, and a few stars. That's it.

Then, after completing the first room, we can add something to the short
description of the room:

"and a poster, which looks different than before."

Then, when you examine the poster.

"You swear there are more stars than before. And now there is a building in the
distance that appears to be a house."

The poster will change throughout the game, and the visual changes described
within it will help tell the story.
