As you approach the pizza place in the food court, you are hit by the delicious
aroma of freshly-baked pizza. The restaurant is a small, open stall with a
glass display case filled with freshly-made pies. The smell of melting cheese
and tomato sauce is mouth-watering, and you really want to get your hands on a
slice.

The stall is staffed by a few friendly pizza makers, dressed in white aprons
and hats. They are busy tossing dough, spreading sauce, and adding toppings to
create perfect pies. The menu is simple but satisfying, with options for
cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and veggie pizzas. You can order by the slice or
get a whole pie to share with friends.

You really want to get a slice, but you are still afraid of disturbing the
timeline. You begin your sad walk away, head down, and that is when you notice
a rectangular object on the ground. It looks like the precursor to the cell
phone.

It is a pager! (A pager is a small electronic communication device that was
popular in the 1980s and 1990s before the widespread use of mobile phones. It
is also known as a "beeper". The pager allows the user to receive short text
messages, or numeric codes, which are sent via radio frequencies by a paging
service provider. The pager receives the signal and alerts the user by beeping,
vibrating, or flashing an LED light. The user can then read the message on the
pager's small screen or display.)
