The starting room will look like your childhood bedroom, your current bedroom,
and will also contain things you've never seen but that you could see yourself
owning some day. The initial room description will mention, briefly, the
contents of the room and the main focus will be on a desk in the center of the
room. On the desk will be an tv/vcr combo, a tablet, and what appears to be a
transparent notebook. (ALL OF THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.)

There will also be a note on the desk written in your handwriting, but you
don't remember writing it. The note will give you instructions on what you need
to do to get started. Right now I am thinking you will turn on the tv. Old tvs
used to not only have the channel number but the band. For instance, on the
screen you would see UHF-73, or something. When you turn the TV on the channel
will be whatever we choose, say UHF-73. This channel will only have static, but
the channel number will be the passcode to unlock the tablet.

The tablet will have folders that initially are empty, maybe their description
can read NULL or something, except for one folder. This folder will contain
your first destination. We can decide how the tablet will allow the gateway to
each room to unlock, but after you read the description we can do something
like have a door, or whatever, appear somewhere in the room. A means of
traveling that was not there before. Then, as you complete levels/rooms,
folders on the tablet are filled with information about what you need to do.
So the first puzzle is turn on the tv -> read the channel letters and numbers
-> unlock the tablet -> first door unlocks. Then you can travel to level one.
