You wake up after the best night of sleep you've had in a long time. It was
almost too good. You feel . . . groggy. Maybe you should get a little more
sleep.

Even with your eyes closed you can tell the room is bright. As much as a little
more sleep would be great, you decide to go ahead and get up. When you open your
eyes you can immediately tell something is different.
