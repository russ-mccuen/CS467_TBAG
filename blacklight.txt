You pick up the black light and shine it all around you. You see random things
you didn't see before, a peace sign, writing on the walls (it looks like
someone wrote Adam loves Marie), some things you didn't see before and don't
want to imagine what they are or where they came from. Then you see a series of
numbers and letters that look eerily similar to what you saw on the television
in your bedroom and the computer from your childhood room. The sequence is:

SEP - 1973

You should probably remember this.

If you want, you can put the blacklight in your inventory.
