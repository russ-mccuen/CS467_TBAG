The dance floor is packed with people who all seem to be doing the same dance.
You watch for a little while and notice that whenever the song changes, the
dance changes, too. But everyone knows every dance and the movements on the
floor are synchronized. It is mesmerizing . . . and kind of eerie.

A disco dance floor is a large, open space that is the centerpiece of the disco
club and the focal point for everyone in the room.

The dance floor is illuminated with bright, flashing lights that create a
dynamic visual display. The surface of the dance floor is smooth and flat, and
it appears to be designed to allow dancers to glide and move their feet easily.

The dance floor looks like an exciting space that provides a place for people
to come together and let loose. It really makes you want to dance. You consider
joining everyone because it looks like so much fun. Then you remember you don't
know any disco dances and decide to sit this one out.
