This is the template for all the rooms. It just includes brief descriptions to
allow it to be looked over, and if we agree we can move on to more in-depth
descriptions.

To incorporate AI into the project we can add an intro to each room that is
generated by chat gpt. For the 1970s room, the prompt was "describe disco music
like you are in a disco club in the 1970s" We can prompt chat gpt with
something like this for every decade, and this will add something unique to the
project that incorporates tech everyone is talking about.
