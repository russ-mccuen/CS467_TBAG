As you look around the food court, see all the options and smell all the
smells, you realize how hungry you are. Maybe you should grab something to eat.
Or did you read something (or see something in a movie) about not interacting
with the timeline? What if you change something and the world ceases to exist
or infinite timelines are created and you go back to a world that is not what
you left it just because you wanted to get something to eat but the food smells
really good and maybe you could just . . .

Enough.

You know you are here for a reason. You need to find something from this time
to help you explore whatever else needs to be explored to figure out whatever
it is you are trying to do. So you take a look around.

There is a mall directory that lists not only all the shops in the mall but
also all the options in the food court.

There is a pizza place across from you in the food court and the smells coming
from it are amazing. It might be worth checking out.
