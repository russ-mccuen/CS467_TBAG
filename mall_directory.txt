The mall directory is a large, freestanding, colorful display, with a metal
frame and a large glass front. Behind the glass are several panels of colorful
maps and directories, each with a different section of the mall.

The maps are laid out in a grid, with each store marked with its name and
location. They are color-coded, with each section of the mall represented by a
different color. The directory is well-organized and easy to read, with clear
labels and a simple, straightforward layout.

You see bold lettering that reads, "You are here" and a red dot that places you
in the middle of the food court. You notice that the stores all have
numbers and letters that denote their places in the mall. Food court
eateries all start with "FC", and you notice that the pizza place occupies
location FC 15. For some reason you think this is important.
