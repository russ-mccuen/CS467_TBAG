You see a room that looks like the room you usually sleep in. Against the wall there is a desk. There are posters on the wall, but they are posters you had on your wall as a child. At least a few of them are. You think.

You can see there are a few items on the desk.

There is no door to the room. Actually, you can not see any way of either entering or exiting the room. There are not even any windows. You know you have a window in your room. At least you think you do.

There is nothing notable in the rest of the room.
