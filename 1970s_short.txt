You are in a disco. There are people dancing, there is loud music, and you
immediately think about joining them. Then you remember you don't know any
disco dances.

There is so much going on on the dance floor that it might be worth a second
look.

There is a disco ball hanging above the dance floor that also captures your
attention.
